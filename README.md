# burger

See the deployed application [here](https://fathomless-stream-75321.herokuapp.com/)

This app is a full stack app which takes in user input, stores the data in a persistent database, and updates the page dynamically when buttons are clicked.

To add a hamburger to eat, type in the box and click submit. It shows up on the left column with a number. When you want to eat a burger, click the devour button next to it and the burger is moved to the burgers already eaten column.

The app uses Express and three files (burger.js, orm.js, and controller.js) to control server requests. Get, Post, and Put methods are all employed.

The app uses handlebars to control the html serving process.
